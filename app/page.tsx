          I am a recent graduate from the University of Edinburgh, holding a BSc in Biotechnology 
          and Computer Science. My passion lies in solving real-world problems through software 
          engineering.

          <p className="mb-4">
          I love learning new things, in fact, I made this website to learn about React, Next.js
          and shadcn/ui. Outside of academics, Iâ€™m an avid foil fencer and served as Vice President 
          of my varsity team, helping to build a strong, engaged community.
